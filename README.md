###  Lumi is built using the following technologies:

- This project uses the [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) framework for building web applications. Next.js is a React-based framework that enables server-side rendering, static site generation, and automatic code splitting, which enhances the performance and scalability of web applications.
- For the backend, the project uses [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/), a progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, scalable, and maintainable server-side applications. NestJS leverages TypeScript and follows the modular architecture pattern, making it suitable for complex applications.
- For persistent storage (database caching), the app uses [Redis](https://redis.io/), an in-memory data structure store that can be used as a cache, message broker, and queue. Redis improves performance by providing quick access to frequently accessed data, supporting operations like key-value stores, lists, and sets.
- The app uses the font [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat) as its font, and the design of the app adheres to modern web design principles.
